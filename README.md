# selfbot
Discord Selfbot. Mostly for finding statistics and friends on a server, possibly including dictionary features later. Mostly started to learn Discord.js API.

Selfbot are taking a good 10 minutes before it logins as of May 2017, which is making development highly unpleasant, so I'm probably not going continue this until that changes.
